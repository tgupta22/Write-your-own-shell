# Write-your-own-shell
Display a command prompt and read in a command line from the user (the prompt must be CS361 >, otherwise it cannot be detected by the test script) Your shell must support basic piping like the unix shell. $ command Run command, with stdin and stdout connected to their usual files. When command finishes, the parent should output pid:%d status:%d\n (with the proper relevant values inserted into the format string), and then print the prompt again and wait for more input. $ command1 | command2 Run command1 as in #1, but redirects the output of command1 as input to command2. Note that there should be two instances of pid:%d status:%d\n output. $ command1 ; command2 Run command1 as in #1, wait for it to finish, and then run command 2 as in #1.
